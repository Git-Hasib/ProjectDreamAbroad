# ProjectDreamAbroad

This is a Higher Study Portal web platform, where a user can register themselves, find University Admission Procedure, Scholarship Scheme Info, Researcher and research information from all over the world, find proper resources and guidelines of several tests like IELTS, GRE, SAT, etc. Users can apply wherever they qualified through our AGENT.  (This is basically my DBMS term project during my undergrad.)

I've implemented this web platform using the tools mentioned below.
   * HTML for structure the webpage and its contents.
   * CSS and its framework Bootstrap v5 for designing the contents and creating the client-side environment (Front-end Development).
   * PHP as Server-side-scripting language (Back-end Development).
   * MySQL for Relational Database Management System.

Explore and Enjoy.
